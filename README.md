Distributed Software, LeBonPain

This is an alpha version of a prototype distributed software, where clients of a large bakery (Le Bon Pain)
can place orders for baked goods that will be delivered at scheduled times. This is important for cafes, 
restaurants, grocers, and other vendors who rely on a constant supply of fresh baked products.

The LeBonPain prototype is based on the distributed architecture, where customers install a local version 
of the software and then connect to the LeBonPain servers using a secured and encrypted TCP connection. 
Orders can then be placed, using registered accounts and typical payment gateways such as credit card and Paypal.

To be clear this whole project is the cumulation of learning undertaken over 2 and a 1/2 years at CQUniversity, with elements
used from over half a dozen IT units such as OOP Java programming, Networking, Distributed Systems and more.
The plan for this project is to implement much of what was learnt in the vein of software development and networking,
and adding technologies and features to the LeBonPain software, that were taken from those lessons.

Currently this is a slow work-in-progress type of project, with more features to come. For example soon I hope to integrate
a shopping cart and payment system that connects to a paid server hosted database, to simulate real world testing.

More documentation and project management content to come.
